- Brief explanation of your experience or reflection<br/>

  Navigating Figma was easier for me this time because I've used it before but that was only once so I already forgot some of the basic aspects. But thanks to this tutorial, I was able to recall it and not only I was able to play more on the shapes and colors, I gained more understanding this time which I wasn't able to get the first time I used the application.
