#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>

    Answer:
    - I'll go with ***Shopee***.
      - In their web application, Shopee uses actual pictures of objects for their category icons, which I don't usually like in designs because personally, I think it's not aesthetically pleasing when websites don't use consistent and minimalist same colored icons. But surprisingly, I like how Shopee incorporate real life objects as icons in their app. It made the categories stand out and easy to identify. However, I can't seem to find the same comprehensive category section in their mobile application.
      - Products you have recently searched or showed interest in shows up right at the bottom of the search bar.
    - ***Lazada***
      - They rely more on text with no icons for different categories, all jam-packed on the left side, not even sorted alphabetically and in a low contrast font color, making it hard to easily see the product you are looking for. But still, props to them, because when you land the cursor in a category, sub-categories show up and it keeps getting specific as you delve deeper without opening a new tab.
      - In terms of their mobile application, same with Shopee, I can't seem to find the category section. Like you actually have to search for the product you are looking for.


-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>

    Answer:<br/>
    
    The Category Tab in the upper middle section of Lazada (LazMall, HOME, Grocery). I just found out that this is actually a category section, it doesn't look like it. They should've put a highlight effect to tell the user there are other tabs. I've been using Lazada for so long yet I didn't know until now that there's a section (like a sub-app within the app) which is LazMall and Grocery.


-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>

    Answer:<br/>
    
    ***Shopee***. Both its web and mobile application uses a lot of white space making the interface not overwhelming for the user unlike in Lazada's mobile application, the contents are jam-packed. Also, the font color used in Lazada's website is low contrast making it hard to read the texts unlike in Shopee where they incorporate their signature color orange, not only making the interface aesthetically pleasing, but also highlighting the texts.


<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer:
